Linked Lists C#


A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains two parts:
1. Data: The value stored in the node.
2. Link: A reference to the next node in the list.
For every code we will write, we will have the node class in another file and use it.
How the Node Class looks (without any functions):
        class Node <T>
        {
                private T value;
                private Node<T> next;
                public Node<T>(T value)
                {
                        this.value = value;
                        This.next = null;
                }
        }
To start using linked lists in your code, you will need to add a line at the beginning of the project
The line is:
        using System.Collections.Generic;
How to create a linked list using Node (I am creating the node class):
        Node<{type}> {any parameter name} = new Node<{type}>({value});
